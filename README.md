# JetCert ðŸš€

Hello, I hope you are doing well!

Thank you for your time.

In this Artifact, we have implemented a framework called JetCert. Additionally, we have implemented a self-adaptive system using JetCert, which we will proceed to install and run in the following steps.

## Getting Started Guide
To install and set up this self-adaptive system, you only need to have Docker installed on your system. You can install Docker using [this link](https://www.docker.com/)

After installing Docker on your system, pull jetcert image using the command below:
```bash
docker pull armanheids/jetcert
```

After pulling the JetCert image, you can begin running and testing the self-adaptive system.
