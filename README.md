# JetCert
A novel framework for software systems that aims to establish an optimal trade-off between system safety and feature utilization. In many self-adaptive systems, enhancing safety measures requires implementing more stringent interaction policies. However, these stricter policies often lead to feature downgrading, preventing the system from utilizing its full potential. This creates an inverse relationship between safety implementation and maximum feature utilization, where improving one aspect typically compromises the other. JetCert addresses this challenge by providing a specialized self-adaptive solution, offering unique structures and capabilities that effectively balance safety requirements with maximum system feature utilization. Through its innovative approach, JetCert enables systems to maintain robust security measures while preserving essential functionality, thereby resolving the traditional conflict between safety and feature accessibility in software systems.
